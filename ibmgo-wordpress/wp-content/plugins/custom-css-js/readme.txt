Easily add Custom CSS or JS to your website with an awesome editor.

== Description ==

Customize your WordPress site's appearance by easily adding custom CSS and JS code without even having to modify your theme or plugin files. This is perfect for adding custom CSS tweaks to your site.

= Features =
* **Text editor** with syntax highlighting 
* Print the code **inline** or included into an **external file**
* Print the code in the **header** or the **footer**
* Add CSS or JS to the **frontend** or the **admin side**
* Add as many codes as you want
* Keep your changes also when you change the theme

= Frequently Asked Questions =
* **Can I recover the codes if I previous uninstalled the plugin?**
No, on the `Custom CSS and JS` plugin's uninstall all the added code will be removed. Before uninstalling make sure you don't need the codes anymore.

* **What if I want to add multiple external CSS codes?** 
If you write multiple codes of the same type (for example: two external CSS codes), then all of them will be printed one after another

* **Will this plugin affect the loading time?**
When you click the `Save` button the codes will be cached in files, so there are no tedious database queries.

* **Does the plugin modify the code I write in the editor?**
No, the code is printed exactly as in the editor. It is not modified/checked/validated in any way. You take the full responsability for what is written in there.

* **My code doesn't show on the website**
Try one of the following:
1. If you are using any caching plugin (like "W3 Total Cache" or "WP Fastest Cache"), then don't forget to delete the cache before seing the code printed on the website.
2. Make sure the code is in **Published** state (not **Draft** or **in Trash**).
3. Check if the `wp-content/uploads/custom-css-js` folder exists and is writable

* **Does it work with a Multisite Network?**
Yes.

* **What if I change the theme?**
The CSS and JS are independent of the theme and they will persist through a theme change. This is particularly useful if you apply CSS and JS for modifying a plugin's output. 

* **Can I use a CSS preprocesor like LESS or Sass?**
No, for the moment only plain CSS is supported.

* **Can I upload images for use with my CSS?**
Yes. You can upload an image to your Media Library, then refer to it by its direct URL from within the CSS stylesheet. For example:
`div#content {
    background-image: url('http://example.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/image.jpg');
}`

* **Can I use CSS rules like @import and @font-face?**
Yes.
